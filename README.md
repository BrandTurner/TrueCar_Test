## Notes
If you check the commit history, you can see that I scaffolded this project with my own Yeoman Generator. I tried to delete most of the unncessary code. However, if you go to commit: 2a55bce7b6508f8677f1064a8799b5712e701ab9 and clone this directory (Must run npm install and bower install at the command line after cloning), you can see it in it's full glory.
